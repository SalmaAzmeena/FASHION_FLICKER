Fashion Flicker is a fashion recommendation system designed to suggest similar fashion items based on an uploaded image. Utilizing deep learning and machine learning algorithms, it extracts features from images and finds the closest matches in the dataset. The application is built using Streamlit, TensorFlow, SQLite, and scikit-learn, providing a user-friendly interface for both regular users and administrators.

Features
Fashion Flicker offers a range of features to enhance the user experience. It includes user authentication and registration, allowing users to create and manage their accounts securely. Once logged in, users can upload images and receive fashion recommendations based on the uploaded image. The system also features an admin interface for managing users and images, providing administrators with the tools to maintain and update the dataset. Real-time image feature extraction and similarity computation ensure that users receive accurate and timely recommendations.

Technologies Used
Fashion Flicker leverages the following technologies:

Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
TensorFlow: For deep learning and image feature extraction using the ResNet50 model.
SQLite: For user authentication and image database management.
scikit-learn: For implementing the nearest neighbors algorithm to find similar images.
User Guide
Users can register and log in to the system. Once authenticated, users can upload an image to receive fashion recommendations. Administrators have additional features such as viewing user details and uploading new images to the dataset, which will automatically update the image features and re-fit the nearest neighbors model.
